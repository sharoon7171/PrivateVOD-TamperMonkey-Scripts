# Auto Video Loader

A TamperMonkey script that automatically loads video players on PrivateVOD.com without autoplay. No more clicking the play button - videos load instantly but don't start playing automatically.

## 🚀 Features

- **⚡ Auto-Loading**: Automatically loads video players without clicking play button
- **⏸️ No Autoplay**: Prevents videos from starting automatically - you control when to play
- **🎯 Smart Detection**: Waits for required functions to be available in real-time
- **🔧 iframe Modification**: Disables autoplay by modifying iframe URL parameters
- **⚡ Instant Execution**: Loads as soon as conditions are met - no delays

## 🎬 How It Works

### Real-Time Function Detection
1. **Waits for required functions** (`loadPlayer`, `AEVideoPlayer`, jQuery) to be available
2. **Calls `loadPlayer()`** immediately when all conditions are met
3. **Modifies iframe URL** after player loads to disable autoplay
4. **No function overriding** - preserves all original functionality

### Technical Flow
```
Page Load → Wait for Functions → Call loadPlayer() → Modify iframe URL → Done
```
